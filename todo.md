    - README.md
    - .gitignore
    - Linter/formatter configuration files

---

## 2. Testing Framework Setup
- [ ] **Frontend Testing (Flutter)**
  - [ ] Configure `flutter_test`
  - [ ] Write initial "Hello World" test
- [ ] **Backend Testing**
  - [ ] Configure testing framework (e.g., Jest for Node.js or pytest for Python)
  - [ ] Write initial "Hello World" test

## 3. Frontend (Flutter) Development

### 3.1 Map Screen & Location Tracking
- [ ] **Basic Flutter Project**
  - [ ] Initialize a Flutter project
- [ ] **Map Screen Implementation**
  - [ ] Create a map screen using a map package (Google Maps or similar)
  - [ ] Display the user's live location
- [ ] **Location Services Integration**
  - [ ] Request and handle location permissions
  - [ ] Continuously update the user's location on the map
  - [ ] Write tests with mocked location data

### 3.2 Landmark Visualization & TTS Integration
- [ ] **Landmark Markers**
  - [ ] Add UI components to display markers (simulate initial data)
- [ ] **Native TTS Integration**
  - [ ] Integrate native TTS APIs (AVSpeechSynthesizer for iOS, Android TextToSpeech)
  - [ ] Trigger commentary playback when a landmark is detected within proximity
- [ ] **Component Testing**
  - [ ] Write tests to verify marker rendering and TTS trigger functionality

### 3.3 API Integration (Frontend)
- [ ] **Backend API Calls**
  - [ ] Implement API calls from Flutter to the backend for landmark data and commentary
  - [ ] Handle error states and loading indicators
- [ ] **Integration Testing**
  - [ ] Write integration tests to verify data flow between frontend and backend

---

## 4. Backend (Serverless) Development

### 4.1 Real-Time Location Processing & Landmark Detection
- [ ] **Serverless Function Setup**
  - [ ] Create a function to receive live location data
- [ ] **External Landmark API Integration**
  - [ ] Simulate connection to external landmark API
  - [ ] Implement filtering logic for landmarks within default proximity (1km)
- [ ] **Unit Testing**
  - [ ] Write tests to validate location processing and filtering

### 4.2 Dynamic Queue Management & ChatGPT Integration
- [ ] **Queue Management**
  - [ ] Develop logic to queue commentary requests based on landmark detection
  - [ ] Implement logic to remove a landmark from the queue if user moves >100m away
- [ ] **ChatGPT Integration**
  - [ ] Create integration to send landmark data to ChatGPT for commentary generation (~1-minute narrative)
  - [ ] Implement error logging and handling for API failures
- [ ] **Integration Testing**
  - [ ] Write tests to simulate user movement and verify queue behavior and ChatGPT response handling

### 4.3 API Management & Logging
- [ ] **API Key Monitoring**
  - [ ] Implement basic API key monitoring for external API usage
- [ ] **Error Logging**
  - [ ] Add logging for error tracking and API call failures
- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Write tests to confirm proper error handling and logging

---

## 5. Authentication, Privacy & Settings

### 5.1 Authentication
- [ ] **Google Authentication**
  - [ ] Integrate Google Authentication for user registration and login (Flutter integration)
- [ ] **Testing Authentication**
  - [ ] Write tests to simulate authentication flows (successful and failed login)

### 5.2 Privacy & Permissions
- [ ] **Location Permissions**
  - [ ] Implement native permission dialogs for location access
  - [ ] Display message if permissions are denied: "The app wonâ€™t work without live location."
- [ ] **Testing Permissions**
  - [ ] Write tests to simulate permission granted and denied scenarios

### 5.3 Configurable Settings
- [ ] **User Settings UI**
  - [ ] Add settings for proximity thresholds (500m, 1km, 2km) and update frequency
- [ ] **Settings Persistence**
  - [ ] Implement saving and applying user settings
- [ ] **Testing Settings**
  - [ ] Write tests to ensure settings are stored and applied correctly

---

## 6. End-to-End Integration

- [ ] **Frontend-Backend Integration**
  - [ ] Connect API calls in Flutter to backend functions
  - [ ] Wire UI triggers to backend commentary generation and TTS playback
- [ ] **Comprehensive Integration Testing**
  - [ ] Write end-to-end tests simulating a full user journey from launch to audio commentary
- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Ensure graceful handling of API errors in the UI

---

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment

- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**
  - [ ] Set up automated tests for linting, unit, integration, and end-to-end tests on commits
- [ ] **Deployment Scripts & Configurations**
  - [ ] Create deployment scripts for:
    - Mobile app distribution (TestFlight for iOS, Google Play Beta for Android)
    - Backend serverless functions deployment
- [ ] **Environment Configurations**
  - [ ] Set up configurations for development, staging, and production environments
- [ ] **Final Integration Testing**
