MVP Developer Specification for the Travel Audio Commentary App
1. Overview
The app is designed to assist travelers in new cities by providing automatic, real-time audio commentary about nearby landmarks. The commentary is generated by ChatGPT and covers historical context, architectural details, current usage, and local trivia. This MVP focuses on iOS and Android platforms using Flutter, with a serverless backend for real-time processing.

2. Platform & Development
2.1 Target Platforms
Mobile: iOS and Android.
Development Framework: Flutter for a cross-platform solution.
2.2 User Interface
Map Screen:
Displays the user's live location.
Shows markers for nearby landmarks.
Audio Commentary:
Automatically activated when within a specified proximity.
Uses native text-to-speech (TTS) APIs (AVSpeechSynthesizer for iOS and Android's TextToSpeech API).
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Location Tracking
Data Sources:
Primary: GPS.
Supplementary: Compass and gyroscope data for enhanced directional accuracy.
User Permissions:
Request location permissions on first launch.
If permissions are denied, display a message stating: “The app won’t work without live location.”
Live Tracking:
The map updates the user's location in real time.
3.2 Landmark Detection & Commentary Trigger
Landmark Source:
Utilize a free-tier external landmark API (e.g., Google Places free tier or an equivalent).
Commentary Trigger:
Default proximity set to 1km (customizable by the user with options for 500m, 1km, or 2km).
The location data is continuously monitored, and once a landmark falls within the chosen interval, the backend is triggered.
Relevance Filtering:
If the user moves more than 100 meters away from a landmark before the commentary has been delivered, the commentary for that landmark is removed from the queue.
3.3 Audio Commentary Generation & Playback
ChatGPT Integration:
Send current location and landmark details to a backend service.
ChatGPT generates a separate commentary narrative of approximately 1 minute in length per landmark.
Queue Management:
Commentaries are queued based on detection and prioritized dynamically by relevance (distance from landmark).
When multiple landmarks are detected, the system queues them and only plays the commentary if the landmark remains relevant (within 100 meters).
Playback:
Convert the narrative text to audio using native TTS APIs.
Playback is automatic; however, the user should have an option (in settings for future iterations) to modify proximity thresholds and trigger distances.
4. Backend & Architecture
4.1 Serverless Architecture
Cloud Provider:
Use a provider with a free-tier offering (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) based on cost-effectiveness for MVP.
Services:
Real-Time Processing: Process incoming location and landmark data.
ChatGPT Calls: Handle integration with ChatGPT to generate the commentary.
API Management: Basic API key management to monitor usage limits for external landmark APIs.
Data Handling:
No persistent storage for user settings or location history in the MVP.
All processing is real-time; only temporary caching (if any) should be implemented for active session management.
4.2 Error Handling Strategy
External API Failures:
No fallback mechanisms are implemented for MVP.
If a request to an external landmark API or ChatGPT fails, the system will log the error and skip the commentary for that cycle.
User Feedback:
Since fallback mechanisms aren’t required, the app may simply not provide commentary in the event of an error without interrupting the user experience.
5. Authentication & Privacy
5.1 User Authentication
Method: Google Authentication (free tier) for user registration and login.
5.2 Privacy & Permissions
Location Permission: Prompted on the first app launch using the native permission dialog.
User Notification: Display a clear message if live location permissions are not granted, noting that the app will not function properly without these permissions.
6. Configuration & Customization (MVP Settings)
6.1 Customizable Settings
Distance Intervals for Commentary Trigger:
Options: 500 meters, 1km (default), 2km.
Update Frequency:
Default: Every 5 minutes.
Additionally, update immediately when an important landmark is detected.
Language Preferences:
Setting available for future iterations.
6.2 Landmark Prioritization (For Future Expansion)
Criteria:
Historical significance.
Commercial importance.
Political importance.
For MVP: Use preset criteria based on historical, commercial, and political importance.
7. Testing Plan
7.1 Unit Testing
Location & Sensor Data: Validate accuracy of location tracking using mocked GPS and sensor data.
API Integration: Mock external API calls (landmark API and ChatGPT) to ensure correct responses and error logging.
TTS Conversion: Verify that narrative texts are correctly converted to audio without latency issues.
7.2 Integration Testing
End-to-End Flow:
Simulate a user journey starting from launching the app, receiving location updates, fetching landmark data, generating commentary via ChatGPT, and delivering audio commentary.
Queue Management:
Test the dynamic queue where commentary pieces are removed when the user is more than 100 meters from a landmark.
Error Handling:
Introduce failures in external API calls to ensure the system logs errors without crashing the application.
7.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Real-World Scenario:
Test the app in an actual environment (or simulated environment) to validate that the commentary triggers correctly based on proximity.
Confirm that the audio commentary provides accurate and relevant information.
Feedback Loop:
Collect user feedback regarding audio quality, timing of commentary, and accuracy of landmark details.
8. Deployment & Maintenance
8.1 Deployment
Mobile App: Distribute via TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play Beta (Android) for initial testing.
Backend: Deploy the serverless functions on the chosen free-tier cloud provider with proper monitoring.
8.2 Maintenance
Logging & Monitoring:
Implement logging for API calls and error tracking.
Usage Analytics:
(For future iterations) Consider adding analytics to track usage patterns and identify popular landmarks.
